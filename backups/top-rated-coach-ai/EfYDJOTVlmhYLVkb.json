Compounding this, the complete absence of social proof or testimonials above the fold means you're asking for commitment without building an iota of trust. When prospects *do* scroll, they're hit with 'CLASS IS CLOSED' messages, actively discouraging engagement and signaling that your product isn't even available.\\n\\nYour offers, while priced, lack any irresistible stacking or crucial risk reversal – no free trial, no guarantee, no reason why a prospect should choose Rumble over any other fitness option right *now*. The confusing presentation of 'Packages' without immediate pricing adds unnecessary friction. This isn't just suboptimal design; it's actively sabotaging your conversion rates, leaving massive revenue on the table. You're making prospects work to understand why they should care, rather than overwhelming them with value and a clear path to their desired outcome.\",\n  \"Score\": \"46\"\n}\n```"

The Calls to Action are blunt commands, assuming pre-existing desire rather than generating it, and utterly neglecting the 97% of buyers who need persuasive reasons and low-commitment entry points. Crucially, the complete lack of social proof means there's zero external validation or credibility, forcing potential clients to leap on faith into an unknown. To double conversions, this page demands an immediate, radical overhaul: a 'screaming' headline, prospect-centric benefit statements, an irresistible, urgent primary CTA, and a clear display of social proof to build trust and compel immediate action.
